   Bash Shell Script Library


## Description
   The "bashlib" library is a collection of functions to deal with date, time, lists, some network operations, numbers, output formatting and system gathering info.
   Note that "bashlib" is in an early development stage, so please reconsider visiting it.
   Scripting is really powerful and important for system administrators, providing smarter and automated controlling.
   Bash is a powerful shell and has many built-in functions. But depending on the case, they are not enough.
   The "bashlib was created after a need for date, time and number operations, mainly conversions, file retrieval and sending, simple server checks, results formatting and validations."

## Usage
   In order to use "bashlib" from your script you have to source "bashlib.bash", by using "." or "source" builtin bash function, providing the right relative or absolute path.
   When you source "bashlib.bash" it provides you two functions: "load" and "unload".
   "load" allows you to use a specific function, for example, if you need "normalizeNumber" function you have to insert a line like "load numbers.normalizeNumber" before calling it. It will automatically source the corresponding function file from "pool" directory.
   "unload" allows you the way to get rid of all bashlib functions loaded, so they become unavailable.
